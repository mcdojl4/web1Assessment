# Web Assessment
This repo contains my work that is an attempt to recode the https://aoteamade.co.nz/ using skills learnt in class. We were taught the coding languages: html,css and java to use for creating the websites. Well coding this website i have encountered numerous problems that i have had to learn how to approach the problems and fix them. Some of these were how to overlap code on images or making the images cover the whole grid space and more.



# How to use the project
Currently you can only navigate through the home and shop pages. In the shop page the store currently uses a fetch system using the unsplash api.

# Known issues
Issues i currently have are the websites positions changing when the website is made smaller. 

# Road map
The current road map is finishing the general functions of the website to make it a functioning store. This includes making a filter that can filter through the products and the creating a shopping cart so they can use the main purpose of the website. Then focus on getting the javascript on the home page correct.
